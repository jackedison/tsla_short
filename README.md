On Monday Nov 30th 2020 I entered my first TSLA short.

Entertaining company to follow; valuation is absolute bonkers on S&P500 inclusion announcement.

Opened small short for fun and some Xmas entertainment.

This is some quick code to track performance of relative play, -5 TSLA, +32 VT over the next couple of months. Expecting to take profits/losses in Jan.

Fee rate at IB currently 0.25%.
